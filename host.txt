# Hosting Guide for Render (Free Tier)

This project is configured for deployment on Render, a unified cloud to build and run all your apps and websites.

## Reasons for using Render
- **Native Python/Flask Support**: Seamless deployment for WSGI apps.
- **Free Tier**: "Web Services" free tier is sufficient for this demo.
- **No Config**: Just a `requirements.txt` and `Procfile` are usually enough.

## Limitations
- **Cold Starts**: On the free tier, services spin down after inactivity. The first request might take 50+ seconds.
- **RAM**: 512MB limit, which is plenty for our optimized engine (using <1MB), but tight for massive baselines.

## Step-by-Step Deployment

1. **Push Code to GitHub**
   Ensure `requirements.txt` and `Procfile` are in the root.

2. **Create New Web Service**
   - Go to [dashboard.render.com](https://dashboard.render.com)
   - Click "New +" -> "Web Service"
   - Connect your GitHub repository.

3. **Configure Service**
   - **Name**: `ml-execution-analyzer`
   - **Region**: Any (e.g., Ohio, Frankfurt)
   - **Branch**: `main`
   - **Root Directory**: `.` (default)
   - **Runtime**: `Python 3`
   - **Build Command**: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
   - **Start Command**: `python web/app.py` (or check Procfile)

4. **Deploy**
   - Click "Create Web Service".
   - Wait for the build logs to finish.
   - Click the generated URL to test.

## Troubleshooting
**"Nothing appears after clicking analysis"**
If the page reloads but shows no results:
1. Check the "Debug Block" at the bottom of the page (click "Raw Result Data").
2. Go to Render Dashboard -> Logs.
3. Look for "Received /analyze POST request".
4. If you see "System Error", check the traceback.

## Interviews
**Q: How do you deploy this?**
"I containerized the application logic with Flask and configured it for a PaaS like Render using a Procfile. It binds to the environment's PORT variable and exposes the analysis engine via a simple stateless HTTP API."
